            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Though used sometimes loosely partly because of a lack of formal definition, the interpretation that seems to best describe big data is the one associated with large body of information that we could not comprehend when used only in smaller amounts.[3]
                Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[4] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[5]
            
                Current usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. "There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem."[6] Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to "spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on".[7] Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[8] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.[9]
            
                The size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[10][11] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[12] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5×260 bytes) of data are generated.[13] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[14] According to IDC, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021.[15][16] While Statista report, the global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103 billion by 2027.[17] In 2011 McKinsey & Company reported, if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year.[18] In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than €100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data.[18] And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus.[18] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[19]
            
                Relational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may require "massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers".[20] What qualifies as "big data" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools. Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. "For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration."[21]</p>

        <h2>Definition</h2>
            
            <p> <strong>Big data</strong> Big data can also =<a href="https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/%E5%A4%A7%E6%95%B8%E6%93%9A">big data</a> target="_blank">data set</a> be defined as large amounts of unstructured or <br>
                structured data from various sources. From an academic perspective, the emergence of big data has enabled novel research on a wide range of topics.</p>
            <p><a href="#sec1">Big data</a> consists of huge data sets ( English : Data set ) , the size of these data sets often exceeds the human ability to collect ( English : data acquisition ) , use ( English : data curation ) , manage and process in an acceptable time [16] ] . The size of big data changes frequently, and as of 2012 , single datasets range in size from a few terabytes (TB) to tens of terabytes (PB).
                In a 2001 study and related presentation [17] , Doug Laney , an analyst at the META Group (now Gartner), pointed out that the challenges and opportunities of data growth lie in three directions: : Volume ( Volume , data size), Velocity ( Velocity , speed of data input and output) and change ( Variety , diversity), collectively referred to as "3V" or "3Vs". Gartner and most companies in the big data industry continue to use 3V to describe big data [18] . Gartner revised the definition of big data in 2012: "Big data is a large volume, high speed, and/or changeable information assets, which require new processing methods to promote stronger decision-making capabilities, insight and optimization Dealing with [Original 1] [19] .” In addition, some organizations define the fourth V in addition to the 3V: veracity ( Veracity ) is the fourth characteristic [20] .
        
                Big data must be counted, compared, and analyzed by computer in order to obtain objective results. The United States started to work on big data in 2012, and Obama even invested 200 million U.S. dollars in the development of big data in the same year, emphasizing that big data will be the oil of the future.
        
                Data mining (data mining) is to discuss the methods used to analyze big data. <br>
        
                Big data requires special techniques to efficiently handle large volumes of data that tolerate elapsed time. Technologies for special big data, including massively parallel processing (MPP) databases, data mining, distributed file systems, distributed databases, cloud computing platforms, the Internet, and scalable storage systems.</p>

        <p>Big data can be describe by the following characteristic</p>
        <h4>Valome</h4>
        <p>The quantity of generated and stored data. The size of the data determines the value and potential insight, and whether it can be considered big data or not. The size of big data is usually larger than terabytes and petabytes.[36]</p>
        <h4>Variety</h4>
        <p>The type and nature of the data. The earlier technologies like RDBMSs were capable to handle structured data efficiently and effectively. However, the change in type and nature from structured to semi-structured or unstructured challenged the existing tools and technologies. The big data technologies evolved with the prime intention to capture, store, and process the semi-structured and unstructured (variety) data generated with high speed (velocity), and huge in size (volume). Later, these tools and technologies were explored and used for handling structured data also but preferable for storage. Eventually, the processing of structured data was still kept as optional, either using big data or traditional RDBMSs. This helps in analyzing data towards effective usage of the hidden insights exposed from the data collected via social media, log files, sensors, etc. Big data draws from text, images, audio, video; plus it completes missing pieces through data fusion.</p>
        <h4>Velocity</h4>
        <p>The speed at which the data is generated and processed to meet the demands and challenges that lie in the path of growth and development. Big data is often available in real-time. Compared to small data, big data is produced more continually. Two kinds of velocity related to big data are the frequency of generation and the frequency of handling, recording, and publishing.</p>
        <h4>Veracity</h4>
        <p>The truthfulness or reliability of the data, which refers to the data quality and the data value.[38] Big data must not only be large in size, but also must be reliable in order to achieve value in the analysis of it. The data quality of captured data can vary greatly, affecting an accurate analysis.</p>
        <h4>value</h4>
        <p>The worth in information that can be achieved by the processing and analysis of large datasets. Value also can be measured by an assessment of the other qualities of big data.[40] Value may also represent the profitability of information that is retrieved from the analysis of big data.</p>
